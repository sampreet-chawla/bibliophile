## Lessons Learnt and Accomplishements

- Don't try to rewrite too much stuff when you are debugging (got myself in a nasty bug situation because I refractored too much solving a bug)
- Use sass/scss plain css is outdated
- Dont be too hard on yourself when learning React, allow yourself to learn and relearn and look back onto what doesnt make total sense.
- Remember that your components are like small Islands, they dont connect with one another

## Overall - A Great Day 

Everyone had come out with great projects. It was wonderful watching the presentations and different ideas coming into reality with the same / similar technologies.
